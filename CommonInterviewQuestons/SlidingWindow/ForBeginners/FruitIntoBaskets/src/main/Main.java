 * In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].
 * You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:
 * 	
 *  Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
 *  Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.
 * 
 * Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: 
 * you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.
 * 
 * You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.
 * What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?
 * 
 * Stupidly worded question
 *
 * explanation: 
 * Longest Subarray With 2 Elements
 * Find out the longest length of subarrays with at most 2 different numbers?
 * Solution of sliding window will be easier to understand.
 * Here I share another solution wihtout hash map.
 * Hope it's not damn hard to understand.
