Interview Question #5:
 *Construct an algorithm to check whether two words (or phrases) are anagrams or not!
 *
 *	"An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
 *		 typically using all the original letters exactly once
 *
 *			-> the original word or phrase is called subject
 *			-> any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram
 *
 *		example: restful - fluster
